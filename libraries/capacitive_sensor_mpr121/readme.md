Proximity Sensing with MPR 121  
==============================  
This sketch uses the MPR121 capacitive sensor IC as a proximity and touch sensor. It was adapted from code developed by Jim Bloom and [published on bildr] (http://bildr.org/2011/05/mpr121_arduino/). We've adapted the code to add the proximity sensing capabilities.

Setting Up The Sketch  
---------------------  

###1. Physical Set-up:  
Refer to the hook-up diagram below taken from the bildr blog post about using the Arduino with the MPR121.
* Add the MPR121 breakout board to a breadboard  
* Hook-up the electrodes to the MPR121 breakout board  
* Connect the Arduino to the MPR121 breakout board

###2. Software Set-up
* Load the sketch on the Arduino  
* Open the serial port at 9600 bauds  

Proximity measurements are cumulative readings from all sensors. Therefore, all sensors must be hooked up correctly in order for this measurement to work properly. The individual sensors will continue to respond to touch events.   

How it Works
------------
When proximity state changes the sketch sends out the appropriate proximity state message:  
```
proximity sensed: 'P:1'
proximity released: 'P:0'
```  
  
When touch state of any button changes the sketch sends out the appropriate touch state messages: 
```  
touch sensed: 'touch_sensor_num:1' ['0:1' .. '11:1']
touch released: 'touch_sensor_num:0' ['0:0' .. '11:0']
```  
    
About the MPR121  
================  
This prototype uses an MR121 IC from Freescale, mounted on a sparkfun proto board which is connected to the Arduino via I2C. Here are some useful links related to the breakout board and IC.

* [General documentation page for MPR121] (http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=MPR121)

	* I used this document to figure out how to configure the MPR121 to enable proximity sensing
