Files for the WAV Trigger board need to be in this format:

WAV 16-bit endcoding
44.1 kHz sample rate
Stereo

We need to do the following audio processing

* Remove DC Offset 
* Normalize maximum sound to -1 dB 
* Remove leading and trailing silence 
* Enforce 44100 sample bit rate
* Stereo the tracks if they're mono
* convert to a 16-bit WAV

It looks like sox (http://sox.sourceforge.net/) can do this.  

> sox infile outfile.wav -t wav -b 16 rate 44100 channels 2 norm -1 silence 1 1 0.01% reverse silence 1 1 0.01% reverse

Breaking this down:

"-t wav -b 16" explicity set 16-bit WAV output
"rate 44100" 44.1kHz sample rate for output
"channels 2" enforces stereo.  mono channel is duplicated into two channels.
"norm -1" normalize to -1 dB to prevent clipping.
"silence 1 1 0.01%" trim silence from the beginning.
"reverse silence 1 1 0.01%" trim silence from the end by reversing the audio.
"reverse" reverse the audio again, so we're back to normal.
